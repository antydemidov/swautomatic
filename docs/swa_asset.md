# `SWAAsset`

[â†‘ Up](index.md)

The code defines a class called `SWAAsset`. It seems to be part of a larger project (maybe a game) and it is not clear from this code what exactly the purpose of the `SWAAsset` class is.

The class has an `__init__` method that sets several instance attributes based on the arguments passed. There is also a `from_source` class method that seems to allow for the creation of an instance of the `SWAAsset` class from a dictionary of keyword arguments.
